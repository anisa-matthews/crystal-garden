		<h2>Crystal Garden</h2>
		<h4> Anisa Matthews </h4>

		<p>For my final project, I will be creating a 'crystal garden' with clickable healing stones, particularly of the quartz variety as those tend to naturally come in geometric shape. I imagine the crystals will float, maybe rain down and when the user hovers over them they'll light up.</p>
